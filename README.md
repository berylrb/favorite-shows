## Special Thanks:
Special thanks to <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">the Movie Database API</a> which enables this app to function. 

I'd also like to thank all of the instructors, IAs, and TAs for supporting me both emotionally and academically during the construction of this app. 

A very special thank you also to my supportive classmates (Scott Semlitz, Jordin Huang, Coco Kim, Rachel Kinzel, and Mauricio Lovera to name a few (but not all!)).
